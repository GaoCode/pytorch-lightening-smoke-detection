# Getting Started
## Quick Start
0. Follow the directions on [Nautilus](https://ucsd-prp.gitlab.io/userdocs/start/quickstart/) to set up kubernetes
1. Download ```torch-gpu.yaml``` from the [GitLab repository](https://gitlab.nrp-nautilus.io/anshumand/pytorch-lightning-smoke-detection/-/raw/master/torch-gpu.yaml) to your local working directory and replace instances of ```anshumand``` to ```<your_username>```
2. Create Kubernetes container: ```kubectl create -f torch-gpu.yaml```
3. Confirm pod is running: ```kubectl get pods```
4. Forward port to local machine: ```kubectl port-forward deployment/torch-gpu-anshumand 8888:8888```
5. Open Jupyter Lab on browser (password = ```digits```): ```http://127.0.0.1:8888/```
6. Once Jupyter Lab is opened on your browser, it is recommended to use tmux by entering the following command in Terminal: ```tmux```
7. In tmux, navigate to the correct working directory: ```cd src/pytorch-lightning-smoke-detection/```
7. Run the following command to copy files to the root directory: ```./scripts/setup_files.sh```
8. In a different terminal window, it is recommend to start Tensorboard to access logs: ```tensorboard --logdir ./lightning_logs```
9. Once files are setup, run the following command to run an experiment: ```./scripts/run_train.sh```

## Kubernetes
**Relevant Files:**
- ```Dockerfile```: Code that is run when the container is set up. Uses ```nvidia/cuda``` module as base. Installs system packages and necessary Python packages. Starts Jupyter Lab server at port 8888
- ```torch-gpu.yaml```: Parameters with which the container is initialized
- ```.gitlab-ci.yml```: YAML file that allows CI/CD with GitLab to automatically build new container with Dockerfile changes

**Training Tricks:**
The following steps can increase training speed by 2-5x:
1. Copy the dataset to your home directory using ```./scripts/setup_files.sh```
2. Add ```dshm``` volume to YAML file. Also recommended to specify GPU type to ```2080Ti```, use 4 CPUs, aand set memory=12GB. See ```torch-gpu.yaml``` for an example.
3. Set num_workers=4 (equal to the # of CPUs and 4x # of GPUs) in dataloader


# Data
## Data Locations
**Relevant Files:**
- ```./scripts/setup_files.sh```: Copies raw data and labels into home directory for faster data loading. 
- ```./src/dynamic_dataloader.py```: Includes datamodule and dataloader for training
- ```./data/metadata.pkl```: Dictionary generated by ```DynamicDataModule.prepare_data()``` that includes helpful information about the data. See ```dynamic_dataloader.py``` for the full list of keys.

**Relevant Directories - Raw Data:**
- ```/userdata/kerasData/data/new_data/raw_images```: location of raw images
- ```/userdata/kerasData/data/new_data/raw_images_flow```: location of optical flow images
- ```/userdata/kerasData/data/new_data/raw_images_mog```: location of images processed with MOG background removal

**Relevant Directories - Labels:**
- ```/userdata/kerasData/data/new_data/drive_clone```: location of raw XML labels
- ```/userdata/kerasData/data/new_data/drive_clone_numpy```: location of preprocessed labels created by ```./scripts/prepare_data.sh```
- ```/userdata/kerasData/data/new_data/bbox_labels.csv```: csv file containing bounding box labels for all the images
- ```/userdata/kerasData/data/new_data/drive_clone_bbox```: bbox labels for all images as .npy files

**Relevant Directories - Train/Test Splits:**
- ```./data/final_split/```: data split where train = all the labeled fires and val/test is a random split of unlabeled fires (with night fires removed).
- ```./data/split1/``` and ```./data/split2/```: random train/val/test split of all labeled fires only

**Relevant Directories - Data Cleaning:**
- ```./data/mislabeled_fires.txt```: list of fires that should be thrown out because their binary labels are erroneous (ie. ground truth says there isn't a fire when there actually is)
- ```./data/night_fires.txt```: list of fires that occur during the night (so they can be removed)
- ```./data/omit_mislabeled.txt```: list of images that are supposed to be labeled but do not have bbox labels

## Data Setup from Scratch
Should you lose prior data or receive new data, use the following steps to prepare the data prior to model training:
1. Run ```./scripts/download_raw_data.sh``` to download raw images from the [HPWREN website](http://hpwren.ucsd.edu/HPWREN-FIgLib/HPWREN-FIgLib-Data/) to ```/userdata/kerasData/data/new_data/raw_images_new/``` directory
2. Follow the instructions at the bottom of this [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14cnRoZ9VkYk8y0Wf3__uGAvDXWaGv1dwGrWtTYe75q0/edit?usp=sharing) to download the bounding box and contour annotation labels
3. Run ```python3.9 ./scripts/prepare_data.py``` to create ```./data/metadata_new.pkl``` and .npy label files in ```/userdata/kerasData/data/new_data/drive_clone_numpy_new/```
4. (Optional) Run ```python3.9 ./scripts/generate_flow.py``` to create optical flow outputs in ```/userdata/kerasData/data/new_data/raw_images_flow_new/``` and background removal outputs in ```/userdata/kerasData/data/new_data/raw_images_mog_new/```


# Model
## Model Setup
**Relevant Files:**
- ```model_components.py```: Different loss functions and torch models to use with ```main_model.py```. Each model has its own forward pass.
- ```main_model.py```: Main model to use with ```lightning_module.py```. Chains forward passes and sums loss functions from individual model_components

**Models:**
Models are created with model_components that can be chained together using the ```--model-type-list``` command line argument. Intermediate supervision from tile_labels or image_labels provides additional feedback to each model_component. Models can be one of five types:
1. RawToTile: Raw inputs -> tile predictions
2. RawToImage: Raw inputs -> image predictions
3. TileToTile: Tile predictions -> tile predictions
4. TileToImage: Tile predictins -> image predictions
5. ImageToImage: Image predictions -> image predictions

Special models include:
1. Feature Pyramid Networks
2. Backbones incorporating optical flow
3. Object detection models

## Training
**Relevant Files:**
- ```main.py```: Kicks off training and evaluation. Contains many command line arguments to vary hyperparameters. 
- ```lightning_module.py```: PyTorch Lightning LightningModule that defines optimizers, training step and metrics.
- ```run_train.sh```: Used to easily start training from main.py with command line arguments.

**Steps to Run:**
To run training, use ```./run_train.sh```. You can check ```main.py``` for a full list of tunable hyperparameters as command line arguments.

## Logging
**Relevant Directories:**
- ```./lightning_logs/``` (currently not pushed to repo): Automatically generated each run where logs & checkpoints are saved
- ```./saved_logs/``` (currently not pushed to repo): It is suggested to move logs you want to save long-term in this directory

**Steps to Access:**
Logs can be accessed using Tensorboard: ```tensorboard --logdir ./lightning_logs```


# Other Stuff
**Useful Scripts:**
- ```./scripts/paper_experiments.sh```: kicks off all experiments useful for a research paper (different backbones, ablation study, object detection models)
- ```./scripts/labelme.sh```: sets up [LabelMe](http://labelme.csail.mit.edu/Release3.0/) for generating additional annotations. Only runs partial setup; look at code within file for complete instructions.

**Utility Notebooks:**
- ```helper.ipynb```: code to average test metrics, calculate inference speed, and debug code.
- ```visual_analysis.ipynb```: code to visualize errors, generate videos, and create human experiment.

# Data
## Data Locations
**Relevant Files:**
- ```./scripts/setup_files.sh```: Copies raw data and labels into home directory for faster data loading. 
- ```./src/dynamic_dataloader.py```: Includes datamodule and dataloader for training
- ```./data/metadata.pkl```: Dictionary generated by ```DynamicDataModule.prepare_data()``` that includes helpful information about the data. See ```dynamic_dataloader.py``` for the full list of keys.

**Relevant Directories - Raw Data:**
- ```/userdata/kerasData/data/new_data/raw_images```: location of raw images
- ```/userdata/kerasData/data/new_data/raw_images_flow```: location of optical flow images
- ```/userdata/kerasData/data/new_data/raw_images_mog```: location of images processed with MOG background removal

**Relevant Directories - Labels:**
- ```/userdata/kerasData/data/new_data/drive_clone```: location of raw XML labels
- ```/userdata/kerasData/data/new_data/drive_clone_numpy```: location of preprocessed labels created by ```./scripts/prepare_data.sh```
- ```/userdata/kerasData/data/new_data/bbox_labels.csv```: csv file containing bounding box labels for all the images
- ```/userdata/kerasData/data/new_data/drive_clone_bbox```: bbox labels for all images as .npy files
- ```/userdata/kerasData/data/new_data/drive_clone_filled_bbox```: image mask with bboxes filled as 1s

**Relevant Directories - Train/Test Splits:**
- ```./data/final_split/```: data split where train = all the labeled fires and val/test is a random split of unlabeled fires (with night fires removed).
- ```./data/split1/``` and ```./data/split2/```: random train/val/test split of all labeled fires only

**Relevant Directories - Data Cleaning:**
- ```./data/mislabeled_fires.txt```: list of fires that should be thrown out because their binary labels are erroneous (ie. ground truth says there isn't a fire when there actually is)
- ```./data/night_fires.txt```: list of fires that occur during the night (so they can be removed)
- ```./data/omit_mislabeled.txt```: list of images that are supposed to be labeled but do not have bbox labels

## metadata.pkl
```metadata.pkl``` is a key file containing a dictionary that is generated by ```prepare_data.py``` to assist in the data loading process. The keys of the dictionary are:
- fire_to_images (dict): dictionary with fires as keys and list of corresponding images as values
- omit_no_xml (list of str): list of images that erroneously do not have XML files for labels. Does not include unlabeled fires.
- omit_no_contour (list of str): list of images that erroneously do not have loaded contours for labels. Does not include unlabeled fires.
- omit_no_contour_or_bbox (list of str): list of images that erroneously do not have contours or bboxes. Does not include unlabeled fires.
- omit_mislabeled (list of str): list of images that erroneously have no XML files and are manually selected as mislabeled. Does not include unlabeled fires.
- monochrome_fires (list of str): list of fires that are monochrome
- night_fires (list of str): list of fires that are in nighttime
- mislabeled_fires (list of str): list of fires in which the ground truth has erroneous labels and thus should be removed
- labeled_fires (list of str): list of fires that have at least some labels
- unlabeled_fires (list of str): list of fires that have not been labelled at all
- train_only_fires (list of str): list of fires that should only be used for train (not 'mobo-c')
- eligible_fires (list of str): list of fires that can be used for test or train (not in train_only_fires)
- bbox_labels (dict): dictionary with images as keys and 4-element array of bounding box coordinates as values

## Data Setup from Scratch
Should you lose prior data or receive new data, use the following steps to prepare the data prior to model training:
1. Run ```./scripts/download_raw_data.sh``` to download raw images from the [HPWREN website](http://hpwren.ucsd.edu/HPWREN-FIgLib/HPWREN-FIgLib-Data/) to ```/userdata/kerasData/data/new_data/raw_images_new/``` directory
2. Follow the instructions at the bottom of this [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14cnRoZ9VkYk8y0Wf3__uGAvDXWaGv1dwGrWtTYe75q0/edit?usp=sharing) to download the bounding box and contour annotation labels (Note: to be released to the public in late 2022)
3. Run ```python3.9 ./scripts/prepare_data.py``` to create ```./data/metadata_new.pkl``` and .npy label files in ```/userdata/kerasData/data/new_data/drive_clone_numpy_new/```
4. (Optional) Run ```python3.9 ./scripts/generate_flow.py``` to create optical flow outputs in ```/userdata/kerasData/data/new_data/raw_images_flow_new/``` and background removal outputs in ```/userdata/kerasData/data/new_data/raw_images_mog_new/```

**Generating train/val/test split:**
1. From labeled_fires, remove night_fires and mislabeled_fires. Use as the train set.
2. From unlabeled_fires, split 50/50 between validation and test sets. 

# Model
## Model Setup
**Relevant Files:**
- ```model_components.py```: Different loss functions and torch models to use with ```main_model.py```. Each model has its own forward pass.
- ```main_model.py```: Main model to use with ```lightning_module.py```. Chains forward passes and sums loss functions from individual model_components

**Models:**
Models are created with model_components that can be chained together using the ```--model-type-list``` command line argument. Intermediate supervision from tile_labels or image_labels provides additional feedback to each model_component. Models can be one of five types:
1. RawToTile: Raw inputs -> tile predictions
2. RawToImage: Raw inputs -> image predictions
3. TileToTile: Tile predictions -> tile predictions
4. TileToImage: Tile predictins -> image predictions
5. ImageToImage: Image predictions -> image predictions

Special models include:
1. Feature Pyramid Networks
2. Backbones incorporating optical flow
3. Object detection models

## Training
**Relevant Files:**
- ```main.py```: Kicks off training and evaluation. Contains many command line arguments to vary hyperparameters. 
- ```lightning_module.py```: PyTorch Lightning LightningModule that defines optimizers, training step and metrics.
- ```run_train.sh```: Used to easily start training from main.py with command line arguments.

**Steps to Run:**
To run training, use ```./run_train.sh```. You can check ```main.py``` for a full list of tunable hyperparameters as command line arguments.

## Logging
**Relevant Directories:**
- ```./lightning_logs/``` (currently not pushed to repo): Automatically generated each run where logs & checkpoints are saved
- ```./saved_logs/``` (currently not pushed to repo): It is suggested to move logs you want to save long-term in this directory

**Steps to Access:**
Logs can be accessed using Tensorboard: ```tensorboard --logdir ./lightning_logs```


# Other Stuff
**Useful Scripts:**
- ```./scripts/paper_experiments.sh```: kicks off all experiments useful for a research paper (different backbones, ablation study, object detection models)
- ```./scripts/labelme.sh```: sets up [LabelMe](http://labelme.csail.mit.edu/Release3.0/) for generating additional annotations. Only runs partial setup; look at code within file for complete instructions.

**Utility Notebooks:**
- ```helper.ipynb```: code to average test metrics, calculate inference speed, and debug code.
- ```visual_analysis.ipynb```: code to visualize errors, generate videos, and create human experiment.

# Troubleshooting
- On Debian, change "torch_gtrxl" to "gtrxl_torch"
- If the ```download_raw_data.sh``` script is blocked by robots.txt, add: ```-e robots=off```
